## Ticketswap-like app (Codaisseur personal assessment)

For this project I had to create a full stack web app. Users are able to register and sell tickets for upcoming events (like concerts).

React with Redux was used for the frontend and Typescript for the backend. The database was set up using Postgres and Type ORM.
